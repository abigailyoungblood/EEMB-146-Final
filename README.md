# EEMB 146 Final Project

This is the final project for upper-division biometry course, EEMB 146, focusing on ecological data analysis and modeling using R.

## Project Overview

The project analyzes the interaction between snow hares and snow cover in boreal forests. Pulling data from researchers in Ottawa, Canada, I looked at how the number of days since snow changes snow depth and how snow depth influences survival. 

## Tools & Technologies
